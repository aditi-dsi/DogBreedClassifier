Answer: Based upon my observations of the results from the three models and my answers for the 3 questions above, I find VGG to be the best performing model in the uploaded image classification.
Reasons for it to be the best:
1. It correctly classified Dog breeds, where Alexnet failed.
2. It correctly classified the object image to be of Towel, which is correct. Resnet failed in this case.
3. Considering above cases VGG turns out to be the most effective in classifying objects, dogs, animal, correctly.
