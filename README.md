# Pre-trained Image Classifier to identify dog breeds
  Implemented pre-trained CNN model-architectures to distinguish Dogs from everything else in this world :), followed by identifying their correct breeds.<br/>
  In addition to this, I also implemented and compared the results from 3 great architectures, namely, AlexNet, ResNet, & VGG and found out which one works the best in most of the cases (including edge cases).

#### (_I tested the model with my own images as well, you can do that too !!_)

## How to take model inference for your own images?
1. Move inside 'uploaded_images' directory
2. Delete(or keep) previous files and upload new images. <br/> (Note: Image should be Sqaure in shape, i.e. their length and breadth should be similar px.)
3. Open the terminal and run the below script :
   
   ```
   
   $ sh run_models_batch_uploaded.sh
   
   ```
<hr/>

## Suggestions to get the most out of it:
Try experimenting with variety of images such as :
1. animals other than dog,
2. any random object,
3. or a same picture with different angle would work too !

## Comparison results among AlexNet, ResNet, VGG:

Results clearly shows that VGG shines out.. üéâüåü
